Installing wxEC

Once you have downloaded the installer, simply run it.

It will install wxEC and any files needed to run it in the
directory of your choice. It will also produce a desktop
icon for your convenience.

Uninstalling wxEC

In case you want to uninstall wxEC from your machine, simply run the 
uninstall entry from the start menu. All files, except the .INI and 
log file, if any, will be removed. If you decided to not use the 
program any longer, you can remove the whole directory, although in that 
case you would have to reconfigure the program again, if you decide to 
use it again later.
